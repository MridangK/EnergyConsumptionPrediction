Energy Consumption Time Series Prediction using XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting energy consumption using the powerful XGBoost algorithm. Energy consumption plays a vital role in various domains, including residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Accurately forecasting energy consumption can assist in efficient resource allocation, demand planning, and sustainable energy management.
Introduction

In this project, we leverage the XGBoost algorithm, a popular gradient boosting technique known for its excellent performance in handling time series data. XGBoost combines the power of decision trees with boosting techniques, resulting in highly accurate predictions and robust feature selection.

The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable model that can predict future energy consumption based on historical data. By analyzing and understanding the underlying patterns and trends in the energy consumption time series, we aim to build a predictive model that can capture complex dependencies and variations.
